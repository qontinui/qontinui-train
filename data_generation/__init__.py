"""Synthetic GUI data generation pipeline.

This package contains tools for generating millions of diverse GUI examples:
    - Procedural UI generation: Layout algorithms, component libraries
    - Rendering pipelines: Headless browsers, game engines, native UIs
    - Automatic annotation: Extract bounding boxes from DOM/widget trees
    - Domain randomization: Style, color, font, spacing variations

The generated data is used for:
    - Pre-training large-scale models from scratch
    - Training robust detectors on diverse UI styles
    - Augmentation for real-world training data
